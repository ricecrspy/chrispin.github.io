### BERLIN OUTERWEAR MARKET REPORT

#### 1.1 OBJECTIVE
(Google Data Analytics Capstone) Berlin, a premium streetwear fashion brand, wants to expand by offering outerwear pieces in it's collection. However, before launching the new product line, the company's President wants a high-level report analyzing current market trends and competitors. The Director of Marketing and Sales tasked me with performing market research and to create a report that highlights trends, market insights, and key recommendations using data analytics.

#### 1.3 DATA GATHERING
I identified five e-commerce boutique stores that align with the Berlin's market positioning in terms of price, product design, target customer, and quality. Using a Chrome browser web crawler extension I scraped over 300 rows of data observations, about 30-70 rows from each website, based on the following variables: brand name, product description, colorway, price, discount, and sale price. Data structures varied from store to store and as a result a unique table was created for each totaling five tables.

Using the ```=QUERY()``` function I begin data aggregation, but only after I created matching columns in all five tables: brand_id, description, colorway, sales, and discount columns. Although this method achieved the results I was looking for it was not the most efficient for analysis.

#### 1.4 DATA CLEANING AND MANIPULATION (SQL)

To prepare the data for analysis, I used BigQuery to join all tables into a single dataset under the ```brand_id``` key_id, and combined product_name with description into one description variable. Finally, I had an aggregated dataset; however, I realized that if I extracted string-specific data from the description column, I could analyze product category frequencies at multiple levels. 
<br><br>
Therefore, I created two more variables: ```style_id``` and ```sub_style_id```. Extracted from description using ```REGEXP_EXTRACT()``` and Common Table Expressions (CTE), the first variable represents broad apparel categories (e.g., jackets, coat, track, vest, etc.), and the second variable identifies specific properties such as materials or functions (e.g., down, shell, windstop, etc.). See SQL query below.
<br><br>
```
WITH descrip_tbl AS -- replace decription_id CTE
(SELECT
  brand_id,
  product_name,
  REPLACE(product_name, 'Jkt', 'Jacket') AS description_id,
  
FROM data-analytics-course-413120.gda_course_8_data.outerwear_tbl
GROUP BY brand_id, product_name
),

style_tbl AS  -- Style_id CTE
(SELECT
  brand_id,
  product_name,
  REGEXP_EXTRACT(
    description_id,
    r'Jacket|Vest|Parka|Coat|Fleece|Anorak|Overcoat|
      Peacoat|Gilet|Track Top|Sweatshirt|Shacket|Overshirt'
  ) AS style_id
  FROM descrip_tbl
  GROUP BY brand_id, product_name, description_id

),
sub_style_tbl AS -- Sub_style_id CTE
(SELECT
  brand_id,
  product_name,
  REGEXP_EXTRACT(
    product_name,
    r'Padded|Down|Linner|Puffer|Bomber|Varsity|Hoodie|Flight|Coach|
    Fleece|Shirt|Track|Packable|Nylon|Chore|Shell|Zip|Ripstop|GORE-TEX|
    Packable|Windrunner|Shearling|Quilted|Wool|Twill|Corduroy|Canvas|
    Flannel|WIP|Denim|Windbreaker|PrimaloftÂ®|Cotton|Hoodied|Leather'
  ) AS sub_style_id

FROM data-analytics-course-413120.gda_course_8_data.outerwear_tbl
GROUP BY brand_id, product_name
)

SELECT 
  berlin_ds.brand_id,
  descrip_tbl.description_id,
  style_tbl.style_id,
  sub_style_tbl.sub_style_id,
  berlin_ds.price
  
FROM 
  data-analytics-course-413120.gda_course_8_data.outerwear_tbl AS berlin_ds 
  FULL OUTER JOIN descrip_tbl ON berlin_ds.product_name = descrip_tbl.product_name
  FULL OUTER JOIN style_tbl ON descrip_tbl.product_name = style_tbl.product_name
  FULL OUTER JOIN sub_style_tbl ON style_tbl.product_name = sub_style_tbl.product_name


GROUP BY brand_id,description_id, style_id, sub_style_tbl.sub_style_id, price
ORDER BY price DESC
